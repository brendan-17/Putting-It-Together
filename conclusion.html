        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In developing a digital environment, several key areas need to be prioritized to ensure both functionality and sustainability. After reviewing the topics of systems design, content architecture, user experience, and the impact of misinformation, I believe that User Experience and Visual Design should be the primary focus. This area is foundational to creating a digital space that is intuitive, engaging, and ultimately serves the needs of its users.</p>
        <p>As Arango (2018) argues, digital environments must not only be technically sound but also generative, helping users make informed decisions that align with their best interests. A user experience that is clear and easy to navigate fosters a positive relationship between the user and the system. When users can intuitively find what they need, the environment becomes a tool for empowerment rather than a source of frustration.</p>
        <p>In designing for user experience, the visual elements must complement the system’s functionality. Clean, well-organized layouts and intuitive navigation allow users to focus on their goals without being distracted by unnecessary complexity. As Arango (2018) emphasizes, such environments should be resilient, meaning that they should not only meet current needs but also evolve with the changing demands of users.</p>
        <p>Therefore, prioritizing user experience and visual design ensures that the digital environment remains effective, ethical, and user-centered over the long term. By making these elements central to the design process, we can create a space that is not only functional but also generative—an environment that respects the user's time and attention, ultimately fostering trust and long-term engagement.</p>
